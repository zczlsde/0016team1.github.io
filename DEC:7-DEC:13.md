**Did not receive feedback from client**

During this week, we did not receive any feedback from our client for the drafted survey and enquires related to things we were expected to work on.



**Overlapping tasks with Team 2**

During this week's meeting with our TA, we noticed that Team2, working with the same client as us,  has made a complaint about their developing tasks. After talking to their group, it seemed that our clients clearly mistook the two groups of us, assigning the same task for both of us. 

Therefore, we arranged a meeting with Dr. Fu to discuss this issue to discuss the separation of tasks and the potential of our two groups working together on the same engine to achieve. In other words, we are considering whether it will be applicable for us to provide an interface for Team 2 to collectively improve the capability of our project.



**Future plans and new idea proposals**

After the meeting with Dr. Fu, our team proposed new approaches to address the client requirements in the following ways:

- We concluded from the "round table notes", a research program our client lead, to picture  the "data engine" we want to build
- Looked for advices to improve our accessibilities from our client, who is the professor of HCI
- Separation of working tasks with Team 2 and proposed ways for future collaborations
