**Round table meeting, OCT/22**

We participated in the first "round table meeting" organised by our client and her co-founders and was introduced to all their ideas, intiatives and plans to carry out their project. We drafted a metting brief and sent is back to our client for view.



**Questions we proposed after attending the meeting**

1. What is our role in this project? Or to be more specific, what is the requirements and “must-have”s for us to achieve?
2. What’s features should we expect to be on the data analytic engine? Will we make a rule-engine platform like MS Azure or performing required analysis on the given dataset or maybe about evaluating, cleaning and formatting various datasets?
3. And if it’s an analysis task, we want to know what we are looking for from our datasets?
