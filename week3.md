## Progress in this weeek 
This week is about the basic design of frontend. Bootstrap is uesd below Django framework so a static folder is added including css, js and fonts, which are downloded 
from the Bootstrap website. Furthermore, a file called jquery.min.js is downloded and added to the js folder.

## Difficulties 
1. The design of outlooking of our website.
2. It is really hard to contact our client because they seldom give reply or feedback.
