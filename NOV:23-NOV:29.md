**Finished project prototyping and looking for client review **

In this week, we finished the prototyping/personas for our project design and tried to arrange a meeting with our client. We didn't hear back from our client for 4 days; so we send an update message and finally arranged a meeting next week.



**Prepared questions for next week's development**

In order to prepare for the meeting we have with our clients, we posted a couple of questions we wanted to know to facilitate the meeting:

- Scale of the database(Decides the database system we will be working with)
- Preferred Functionalities, anything the client want to have?
- How the database will be given(How to read/store/load from the database)
- What are the essential analysis required for our project in the visualizer modules
