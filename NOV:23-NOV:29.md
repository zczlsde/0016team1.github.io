Email with TA



By the time I wrote this email, I haven't received any reply from Prof. Holloway, (My inquiry email was send on Monday, 11.23, 3pm. I will be writing another message on MS Teams to update her on our status. 

 

In the case we still cannot reach out to our client to discuss how we should carry out the project, should I contact the module lead about this matter. In other words, should I email Dean to update our status and explain what happened to keep us on track? Please let us know how we should handle this situation.
