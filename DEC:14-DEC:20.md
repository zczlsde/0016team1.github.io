**Course-wide meeting with Module lead-Dr. Dean**

This week we had the meeting with our module lead, Dr.Dean, about the frequently asked questions and what are we expected to do for the imminent "elevator pitch" presentation.

We reported our case with the moduler lead about client not responding, and he promised to talk to us about the issue and to discuss this with our clients.



**Research on how to address client requirements**

We researched ways to carry out our client requirements, especially trying to address the need of "visualizers". We also considered how to construct an data engine with accessibility designs. Our client requested us to provide a mobile version of our data engine, which made us panicked ; we investigated on this topic and decided that it may not have the sufficient time for us to develop both a mobile app and a computer software.
