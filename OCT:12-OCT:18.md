**Team formation and discussions on how to carry out the project**

We received an email from Dean from Monday this week confirming the teammates and project tile of this module. We registered Trello, Miro websites and prepared us with further discussions. And we arranged our first meeting at this week with our client and set up a plan for our questions used in the first meeting.

*Questions to be interviewed for our client*

- What's our target? What we are looking at for the analysis task?
- Info about our data source, whare are the formats and how should we use those posts to perform analysis?
- How we define this "Assistive tech Term"

**Issue in metting with our client**

We arranged our first meeting with our client at 4:30 Friday, Oct/16th but the time changed to 5:30 Thursday, Oct/15th. And we missed that call due to miscommunication. Luckily, we re-arranged another meeting with our client to introduce us to her developing team the next Thursday.

**Sample reference website**

During our communications, our client sent us a sample website and asked us to reference to that particular website.
