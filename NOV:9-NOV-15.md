Last week we focused on interactive designs for our HCI project, especially on prototyping and describe usage scenarios. We created a three page prototype on Pidoco which illustrates our design in terms of how user operates to get their desired search result, and two Personas representing our typical users: professional researchers and enthusiastic students.

 

We also discussed on the possibilities of a more dynamic approach to meet potential user requirements, because our client, Professor Holloway updated us on the dataset we are going to work with last Tuesday(10th Nov) and the final format of the dataset is not yet determined. At this moment, we have the brief picture of what we are going to create but we still need to leave some space for further user customisations.

 

Our plan for this week is to figure out the details in deploying our data search engine( whether it should be a local software, a distributed file system or maybe a website with open access) and discuss the feasibilities of each individual approaches.
