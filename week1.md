## Plan Upadate
Our project consists of two main parts: a data visualiser and a data management system.

MTV model would be applied in our dijango. MTV are model, template and view, respectively.

Model is in charge of Object Relational Mappping(ORM). View is for bussiness logic and template is for display logic.

## Code Update
The basic code of django framework is pushed on github by simply using "django-admin.py startproject ATanalysis" command
Lots of csv file is provided by our client. One of them is called "Articles" is transfered to SQLite3 Database and a python 
file to view this table in the database is added in the folder as well.

## Current difficulties
1. Django is still unfamiliar, which require us to contribute more on learning it.

2. Functions of some csv file contents are still unknown.
