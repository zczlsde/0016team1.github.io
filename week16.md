## This week work

It is would be complex for us to write all html, css and js files by oursevles at the very beginning. Therefore, bootstrap was applied in this project. All the related bootstrap files were put in the static folder. A simple bootstrap template under MIT license was implemented(https://github.com/nikolak/djangotemplate), including a navbar.html and a base.html. 

To make it fit in our website, the
navbar html is changed because four buttons were enough linked to home page,
visualizer, search page and forum part. The log in box was deleted because it was
not in our design. There are four buttons added in navbar.html which allows the jump between home, search, visualizer and the forum page. Base.html defines the top and the bottom of the page included the navbar, which could be extended by other pages keeps the same style of frontend of this project.

## Next Plan

Our team is still confused about how to retrieve articles so future plan would be lean the retrieve of database and fixing exited bugs in the frontend and building the group portfolio website.
