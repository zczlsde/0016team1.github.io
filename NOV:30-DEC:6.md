**Meeting with client at Monday 30th Nov**

During the meeting with our client, we received updates on example websites that the client is running and they hope us can use those results as reference to build our project.

On the other hand, we updated our client on our persona files, prototypes and proposed plans to carry out the requirements they listed last time. We were also trying to integrate the idea of those websites into our project.

At the end of the meeting, we received an example web-source app with data we required to work with.



**Future plans**

We were suggested to draft a survey about the AT data engine we aimed to create and our client will be holding it for us during her next meeting. We hope to receive feedbacks from her about how our data engine is expected to be used.



**Survey questions**

In our drafted servey, we were looking for the answers for the following questions:

- Reasons why people want to use our data engine?
- Pros and cons of exisitng designs? And how we can improve from similar projects?
- Useful modules/functionalities users are looking for about AT research?
