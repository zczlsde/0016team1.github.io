## DevelopmentWeek1: 
The team has designed the structure and set up the database. They encountered some technical problems in setting the website for the data engine because they don't have experience in front end and back end development. The next step would be to learn the front end and back end development and try to solve the above technical issues.

## DevelopmentWeek2: 
This week is about the basic design of the front end. The team found some templates for their system and made the home page. The plan for the future is to work on a simple but structured software and gradually add functionalities according to further user requirements. They confirmed the arranged meeting with their client this Friday, and are planning to structure a prototype for illustration purposes.

## DevelopmentWeek3: 
The team met clients last week and further modified their project plan and design. Lyu and Wang will be assisting Deng in front-end designs and setting up the back-end service this week.

## DevelopmentWeek4: 
The team has set up the database and started to build the front end based on a template, still debugging because there were some issues when retrieving articles. The future plan would be fixing bugs and building the group portfolio website.

## DevelopmentWeek5: 
The team was working on setting up the database and allowing direct access to the database. The plan is to add new functionalities to support storing uploaded csv files and to display the database for illustration purpose.

## DevelopmentWeek6: 
The team built a prototype of the search engine, which is indexed by haystack and searched by elasticsearch. They also provided various visualization methods for the data. The plan for next week is to further improve the visualizer and front-end stuff.

## DevelopmentWeek7: 
The team further improved the visualizer to make it change in place instead of jumping to another page. They met the client last week and the client was happy about their progress. The plan is to finish the system and the report website before the next session.

## DevelopmentWeek8: 
The team finished all the developing process and their program will be deployed on their client's server soon.
