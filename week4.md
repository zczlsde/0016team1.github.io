## COMP0016 Team 1, Project plan and requirements(Final Version)

## Key problem to address:
1. Provide a "tag-based"data management system for AT data sources
2. Visualiser to process and display the data stored in the system
3. An accessible platform to benefit AT researchers to understand their user requirements

##Must haves:

A visualiser that collects data from a data source and display it in many different ways
Reference website: https://coronaviruswatch.ircai.org/?country=All&dashboard=news

A database management system used to control our data stored based on a predefined set
of "tags" using django and elastic search
This design came from visualization of eventribute data using a tree structure on : http:/
/at.ircai.org/

A local server that supports the running of our data engine(including visualiser and the
database)

##Should have:
User accessibility designs in all web-pages required

Mobile adaptive system to suit different terminal devices(The above requirements will be considered with in the design of backend system for server
and database system)

##Would haves
A forum that allows users to register/login/post/comment our their experiences with AT
devices (An example of this forum would be "https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/")

Provide interface to use algorithms to categorise user posted articles

##Could haves:
Moderations/censership for posts on our data engine

Other adaptivity design for a forum-like website etc

##Why our design?
The lack of communities for AT users

User posting of their own experienece will show how AT research make a difference

Direct users feedbacks of AT devices and propose 1st hand improvements

Inspires AT researches have a clear target what to develop

##Some additional details:
We will use dummy dataset to test/develop our system, which represents the media source/
academia source dat in the requirements
