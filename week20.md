## This Week

We met the client last week and the client was happy about their progress. 

Then we finished all the developing process and their program will be deployed on their client's server soon.

## Possible Future Plan

We understand that our work is a limited implementation of our grand expectations; therefore, we prepared interfaces that developer can work on for project refinements. First, we want to update the database system by adding “tags” that extracted each data file we stored. This can be achieved through our client’s other ongoing project. This change will allow us to provide more accurate search results and to generate reports by reviewing the contents. Secondly, we want to support more graph types in our visualizer module. Indeed, we included a builder patter and a “option” file for graph configurations, but due to the limitation of Python OOPs, we did not have enough parameters to fully explored the capability of ECharts. Finally, we want to improve our forum module to create an open platform for user experiences with AT devices.
